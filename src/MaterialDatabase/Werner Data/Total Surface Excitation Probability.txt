aNFE=0.173eV^(-1/2)

SEP-values [1,2,3] can be estimated from the formula [2]: 
Ps(?)=1/(vE a cos?+1) where Ps is the average number of surface excitations in a single surface crossing in the polar direction cos? for an electron with energy E and a is the surface excitation parameter. Experimental values for this quantity are given in the table on the right in units of aNFE=0.173eV-1/2. The probability for experiencing a certain number of surface excitations during a single surface crossing is then obtained from Poisson statistics: P(0)=exp(-Ps(?)), P(1)=Ps(?) exp(-Ps(?)), P(2)=P2s(?) exp(-Ps(?))/2, etc. For materials not in the table, the surface excitation parameter a may be estimated from the formula a/aNFE=0.039h?p/2?+0.4 where h?p/2? is the generalized plasmon energy in eV.
